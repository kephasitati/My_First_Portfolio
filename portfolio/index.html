                    <h3>KEDIPA Website</h3>
                    <p>I had the privilege of developing and designing the Kedipa <em>(Kenya Disability Parliamentary Association)</em> website, a project close to my heart.<br>
                        In recognition of the diverse needs of Kedipa's visually impaired members, I integrated an accessibility button to ensure equal access to the website's content and services.<br>
                        This project was not just about web development; it was a commitment to digital inclusivity and advocacy for disabled individuals in Kenya.<br>
                        I'm proud to have contributed to a platform that advances the cause of KEDIPA and promotes accessibility for all.</p><br>

        <section id="about-me">
            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I recently worked as the IT Manager for Molars Dental Practice, a clinic with five branches across Kenya, and previously as the Technical & IT Support Manager for Trace Eastern Africa, a prominent division of the internationally acclaimed brand, Trace.<br> 

                Driven by an unwavering dedication to devising cost-effective solutions in the realms of IT, broadcast, and entertainment, I aspire to leverage my substantial expertise to help businesses embrace tech to cut costs, enhance business solutions and establish a prominent standing among Africa's leading IT professionals within the next five years.<br>

                My tenure at Byce Broadcast before joining Trace was marked by significant accomplishments including spearheading successful installations and integration projects featuring cutting-edge LAWO Broadcast equipment at Royal Media Services and many other projects.<br> 

                Furthermore, I am playing a pivotal role in the transformation of audio transportation technology, advocating for the adoption of budget-friendly IP-based solutions as alternatives to the more expensive satellite options widely utilized by media organizations.<br>

                With a discerning eye for innovation and a steadfast commitment to advancing Africa's technological landscape, I remain dedicated to making impactful contributions within the spheres of IT, entertainment, and broadcasting.</p>
                <br>
            <p>In addition to my technical skills, I am also an entertainer and performer with a passion for music and the arts. I have performed at various events and venues around the country and have a strong following on social media.<br>
                When I'm not working or performing, you can usually find me spending time with my beloved family and dogs, who are a constant source of joy and inspiration in my life.<br>
                I am always looking for new opportunities to learn, grow, and make a positive impact in my professional and personal endeavors.</p>
